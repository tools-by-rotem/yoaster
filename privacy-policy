**Remote Code Permission** 
Grants the Extension the ability to load a remote button for donations, which is used to support the development and maintenance of the Extension.
**Data Security**
Although we do not collect any personal data, we take reasonable measures to protect the data you choose to share with us (e.g., through the donation button) from unauthorized access and misuse.

# Third-Party Services
